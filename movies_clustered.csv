She playfully interviews and interrogates a cast of characters of varying reliability, eliciting refreshingly candid, yet mostly contradictory, answers to the same questions.

Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving.

tt7557108,Saint Maud,2019,"Drama, Horror, Mystery",Rose Glass,"Morfydd Clark, Caoilfhionn Dunne, Jennifer Ehle","There, but for the grace of God, goes Maud, a reclusive young nurse whose impressionable demeanor causes her to pursue a pious path of Christian devotion after an obscure trauma. Now charged with the hospice care of Amanda, a retired dancer ravaged by cancer, Maud's fervent faith quickly inspires an obsessive conviction that she must save her ward's soul from eternal damnation - whatever the cost. Making her feature-film debut, writer/director Rose Glass cannily lures the audience into this disturbed psyche, steadily setting up her veritable diary of a country nurse for an unnerving and ultimately shocking trajectory. Morfydd Clark (also at the Festival in The Personal History of David Copperfield) portrays the sanctimonious Maud with an intense stoicism that belies a disquieting vulnerability, as Maud desperately vies for absolution and solidarity from her embittered patient (an enthralling Jennifer Ehle, also at the Festival in Beneath the Blue Suburban Skies). Glass tenderly captures this relationship with an empathetic gaze that first assumes an ethereal, dreamlike atmosphere - but it isn't long before Maud's dogmatic candor incites an irreconcilable friction that spirals her mind into a suffocating confluence of creeping doubt and paranoia. As Glass tightens the screws on her misguided martyr, well-placed nods are made to religious horror forerunners like William Friedkin's The Exorcist, further contributing to the film's increasingly dread-filled malaise. And when this insidious fever climatically breaks, the consequences are devastating and terrifying in equal measure.",6.6,"52,802",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzIwMjVlMWMtMGRiYi00OTQyLThhYjEtMDQxMThjMmQ2ODBiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,R,12 Feb 2021,84 min,Rose Glass,"English, Welsh",United Kingdom,Nominated for 2 BAFTA 11 wins & 33 nominations total,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.6/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '92%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '83/100'}]",83.0,movie,3

Allied Forces stand on the brink: a massive army is secretly assembled on the south coast of Britain, poised to re-take Nazi-occupied Europe. One man stands in their way: Winston Churchill. Behind the iconic figure and rousing speeches: a man who has faced political ridicule, military failure and a speech impediment. An impulsive, sometimes bullying personality - fearful, obsessive and hurting. Fearful of repeating, on his disastrous command, the mass slaughter of 1915, when hundreds of thousands of young men were cut down on the beaches of Gallipoli. Obsessed with fulfilling historical greatness: his destiny. Exhausted by years of war and plagued by depression, Churchill is a shadow of the hero who has resisted Hitler's Blitzkrieg. Should the D-Day landings fail, he is terrified he'll be remembered as an architect of carnage. Political opponents sharpen their knives. General Eisenhower and Field Marshal Montgomery are increasingly frustrated by Churchill's attempts to stop the invasion. King George VI must intervene. Only the support of Churchill's brilliant, yet exasperated wife Clementine can halt the Prime Minister's physical and mental collapse.

Halley, who survives largely on welfare, has little respect for people, especially those who cross her, it an attitude that she has passed down to Moonee, who curses and gives the finger like her mother. Although the motel's policy is not to allow long term rentals, Bobby, the motel manager, has made arrangements for people like Halley to live there while not undermining the policy as he realizes that many such tenants have no place to go otherwise. Halley, Moonee and Moonee's friends, who live in the motel or others like it along the strip and who she often drags into her disruptive pranks, are often the bane of Bobby's existence, but while dealing with whatever problem arises, Bobby has a soft spot especially for the children and thus, by association, their parents, as he knows that Moonee and others like her are just children acting like a children under whatever guidance they have, Moonee who has less guidance than most. Although there are some lines which he will not tolerate to be crossed, Bobby lets most of the disruptive things that they do go, largely as long as it does not affect the bread and butter of the motel, namely the tourist trade. The summer in this collective is presented, when Moonee and her friends, such as Scooty, are out of school and are left largely to their own devices while self-absorbed Halley does whatever she wants, often just staying in the room watching TV. Halley is supposed to look after Scooty, the son of Halley's friend Ashley, they who live in the unit immediately underneath Halley and Moonee's, while Ashley is at work at a local diner.

The country is in the throes of the Great Depression, the previous decade's boom of Italian, Irish, and Jewish immigrants has led to unprecedented urban expansion, and in the midst of an unseasonably warm autumn, steelworkers risk life and limb building skyscrapers high above the streets of Manhattan.

But Maire's stern husband Alec silently disapproves of Tomas' timidity and halting speech. He can't hide his disappointment that Tomas isn't the kind of child he was hoping for and his reluctance to get to know the boy makes Tomas unsure of whether he really belongs. Soon though, Tomas too falls in love with his home, befriending local children, descending into a secret bat-filled cave, and saving a stranded baby seal. When tragedy strikes however, Tomas is faced with his greatest challenge yet. He'll lose everything unless he can find- and share- the unique gifts inside of him. Risking all, Tomas embarks on a perilous journey where he will need to call on his ability to see joy and color even when in the darkest place, in order to triumph and come home. A Shine Of Rainbows is a story about the transformational power of love, about finding acceptance, discovering ourselves, and realizing that rainbows are all around us- and within us too.",7.1,"2,480",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NjU0ODg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI4OTY4Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg,PG,13 Feb 2010,101 min,"Vic Sarin, Catherine Spear, Dennis Foon",English,"Canada, Ireland",4 wins & 8 nominations,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.1/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '50%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '52/100'}]",52.0,movie,3

tt4414694,Dreams Rewired,2015,"Documentary, History, News","Manu Luksch, Martin Reinhart, Thomas Tode",Tilda Swinton,"'Every age thinks it's the modern age...' - but this one, a time of always-on connectivity, ubiquitous computing, and the acceleration of everything, really is new. No longer even modern, we are allegedly postmodern, post-industrial, and hurtling towards the post-human. With its profusion of desire and superabundance of information, our age couldn't be more different... DREAMS REWIRED offers another perspective. A montage of films from the 1880s to the 1930s, many rare and previously unscreened, it traces contemporary appetites and anxieties back to the birth of the telephone, television and cinema. Its claim: that the social convulsions of today's hyper-mediated world were already prefigured over 100 years ago, during the electric media boom of the late 19th century. Early electric media were as revolutionary as social media are now. They sparked a fervent utopianism in the public imagination; promising total communication, the annihilation of distance, an end to war. The technologies were to serve everyone, not just the elites. Through strengthening human relationships, increasing efficiency, and predicting the future, it would become possible to build a new world for all to share. But what these media initially promised, and what they eventually delivered was very different. The early radical openness was disciplined and regulated, and two-way, peer-to-peer communication gave way to hierarchical broadcasting. And the fears that had accompanied the hopes - fears of the erosion of privacy, of ubiquitous surveillance, of financial exposure and moral hazard - began to appear well-founded. DREAMS REWIRED is an assemblage of clips from nearly 200 films, ranging from the earliest dramatic works to music hall slapstick, newsreels, marketing materials, recordings of scientific experiments, and artistic adventures with film as medium. Through years of research in archives around the world, the directors have unearthed material that is by turns hilarious, revelatory, aesthetically striking, and astonishingly prescient. This footage is spliced together with a commentary on our contemporary predicament (voiced by Tilda Swinton) that, rather than plunging the audience into the past, pulls the historical material into the present. By forging an identification between contemporary viewers and their idealistic peers from 100 years ago, DREAMS REWIRED suggests a path of positive action towards a 21st century conception of openness.",5.9,138,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI4OTYxMzI5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg4ODc0NjE@._V1_SX300.jpg,Not Rated,01 May 2015,88 min,"Manu Luksch, Mukul Patel, Martin Reinhart",English,"Austria, Germany, United Kingdom",2 wins & 4 nominations,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.9/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '75%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '62/100'}]",62.0,movie,3

Dennis and Lonny, who are having financial difficulties, are able to convince rock star Stacee Jaxx, the perpetually stoned front man for the band Arsenal who got his first break performing at the Bourbon, to perform for free at a benefit concert at the club. Rumors are that Stacee is leaving Arsenal after their next gig to go solo, Rolling Stones reporter Constance Sack who wants to get the true story as to the reason.

tt1313104,The Cove,2009,"Documentary, Biography, Crime",Louie Psihoyos,"Richard O'Barry, Louie Psihoyos, Hardy Jones","Richard O'Barry was the man who captured and trained the dolphins for the television show Flipper (1964). O'Barry's view of cetaceans in captivity changed from that experience when as the last straw he saw that one of the dolphins playing Flipper - her name being Kathy - basically committed suicide in his arms because of the stress of being in captivity. Since that time, he has become one of the leading advocates against cetaceans in captivity and for the preservation of cetaceans in the wild. O'Barry and filmmaker 'Louie Psihoyos (I)' go about trying to expose one of what they see as the most cruel acts against wild dolphins in the world in Taiji, Japan, where dolphins are routinely corralled, either to be sold alive to aquariums and marine parks, or slaughtered for meat. The primary secluded cove where this activity is taking place is heavily guarded. O'Barry and Psihoyos are well known as enemies by the authorities in Taiji, the authorities who will use whatever tactic to expel the two from Japan forever. O'Barry, Psihoyos and their team covertly try to film as a document of conclusive evidence this cruel behavior. They employ among others Hollywood cameramen and deep sea free divers. They also highlight what is considered the dangerous consumption of dolphin meat (due to its high concentration of mercury) which is often sold not as dolphin meat, and the Japanese government's methodical buying off of poorer third world nations for their support of Japan's whaling industry, that support most specifically at the International Whaling Commission.",8.4,"52,888",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3Nzg2NzM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYwMjU2Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg,PG-13,07 Aug 2009,92 min,Mark Monroe,"English, Japanese","United States, Japan, Germany, Chile, Canada, United Kingdom",Won 1 Oscar. 39 wins & 18 nominations total,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '8.4/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '95%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '84/100'}]",84.0,movie,3

It is seen as the ""tourist"" church or the ""souvenir shop"" (its historical significance partly it being a stop on the underground railroad before the slaves crossed into Canada) by Abundant Life, which owns the church and which operates a modern self-named five thousand seat church overseen by Reverend Joel Jeffers. First Reformed is celebrating its two hundred fiftieth anniversary this year, for which a major event is planned, modest in size only at First Reformed itself although the dignitaries like the governor and mayor will be at attendance there, while the event will be simulcast at Abundant Life. Most of the speech-making will be done by local industrialist Ed Balq, a major benefactor of Abundant Life and who is the major donor for the necessary upgrades at First Reformed to be able to hold the event there, and for the event itself, while Toller's participation will be minimal beyond the introductory sermon. First Reformed is generally a sparsely attended church meaning that Toller doesn't have to do much direct ministering, although he does have the stock answers when asked how God factors into this or that situation in one's life. Toller himself has long been divorced, his marriage which could not survive the death of their son, Joseph, in war. Because of that history, Toller believes he is incapable of human love, despite a brief relationship with Esther, the choir mistress at Abundant Life, she who is arguably still in love with him. Toller is neglecting the warning signs about his poor health, the symptoms pointing to a probable diagnosis of stomach cancer, which is only exacerbated by his largely liquid (i.e. alcohol) diet. Toller is already examining his life and work in writing a daily journal for a year, that journal which he intends no one ever to read, but these issues in Toller's life become more pointed when a new pregnant congregant, Mary, asks him to speak to her husband Michael, who Toller will learn is an environmentalist concerned about bringing another human life into what he already sees as a world doomed because of man's role in climate change.",7.1,"65,739",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTRkOTUxZDItNDU0OC00ODQzLWJkMWEtYjBiODViNGMyYjhjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg,R,08 Jun 2018,113 min,Paul Schrader,English,"United States, United Kingdom, Australia",Nominated for 1 Oscar. 62 wins & 108 nominations total,"[{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.1/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '94%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '86/100'}]",86.0,movie,1
